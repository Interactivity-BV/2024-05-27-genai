  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its research packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regardless of how you choose to install it,
    <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
    (e.g., 3.6 is fine).
  </p>

   <p>
    We will teach Python using <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>,
    a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
    up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
    Firefox browsers are all
    <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
    (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
    and below, are not). There are four options available to use Jupyter Notebooks:
  </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Jupyter Notebook running locally on your laptop. You can install this through Anaconda or your package manager</li>
     <li>Using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab by Google</a></li>
     <li>Using Visual Studio Code and the Jupyter Notebook plugin</li>
     <li>Connect to your companies infrastructure, when available</li>
     </ul>
