## Generative AI: insights into the technology

During this session we will learn more about LLMs: the technology behind LLMs and how they are used. It will go into the basic functionalities of LLMs, which are needed to make optimal use of prompts and models.


## Summary of the presentation

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Technology aimed at mimicking human abilities like reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and perception.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Uses algorithms and statistical models to execute tasks based on pattern recognition and inference, without explicit instructions.
- **Statistics**: The foundational science for analyzing and interpreting data, essential for AI development.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: A subset of ML that utilizes layered neural networks, excelling in complex tasks such as speech and image recognition.
- **Generative AI**: Focuses on creating new content (e.g., images, texts, sounds) from trained data, emphasizing the versatility in output types.

### Process of Tokenizing and Embedding

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words).
- **Embedding**: Converts tokens into numerical vectors that represent both the literal and contextual meanings of the tokens. This process is critical for machine understanding and manipulation of language.

### Applications and Developments in Generative AI

- **Prompt Engineering**: Often referred to as prompt hacking, it involves crafting queries that guide AI to produce desired outcomes. Used in various applications from grant proposals to blog posts and image generation.
- **Data Analytics and Application Integration**: LLMs can be integrated with APIs like OpenWeather for real-time data processing and activity suggestions based on weather conditions.
- **Automated Document Processing**: Tools like Langchain and ChatGPT can process and generate structured outputs from documents such as scientific papers.

### Practical Examples

- **Weather and Activity Apps**: Combining LLMs with weather forecast APIs to suggest activities tailored to weather conditions and user preferences.
- **Document Automation**: Using LLMs to automatically process and summarize scientific papers, extracting and contextualizing information without manual oversight.
